Similar with the popular website Rate My Professor, Rate My Ex is an online destination to provide feedback on former partners’ personal value and their respective dating behaviors. Choosing the best dating partner is the rite of passage for everyone, and connecting current partners with exs on the site can become a key way for million couples to navigate this process. The site does what people have been doing forever – checking in with each other – their friends, their brothers, their sisters, their classmates, and even their ex-partners- to figure out who is the great boy/girlfriends and who is the one you may want to avoid.

Detail:
We understand a simple overall rating is hard to show a complete person and might hurt egos of people. Without giving a single score, the site designed to dive into details about personalities and habits. It is also important to be honest in review and avoid hearsay. We will give guidance for users to be objective when writing reviews.

Our aim is to build a healthy dating environment with authentic user-generated contents. While all comments are posted anonymously, we asked users to register accounts to make sure they can only rate their exs once and avoid click farming. In addition, if comments avoid of our site guidelines, we will remove those comments for building a better community.
